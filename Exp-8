Aim: Design a system using Arduino that blinks an LED when you detect a motion in an area 
Write working, connections, code and expected output.

Hardware Library: ARDUINO UNO

Components: PIR Sensor, Arduino UNO, Jumping wires, LED

Theory:

"Passive Infra-Red" sensor is a "Pyroelectric IR Sensor" which generates energy when exposed to heat. Everything emits some low level of radiation, the hotter the object is, the more radiation is emitted. When a human or an animal (with IR radiation wavelength of 9.4 µMeter) approaches the sensors range the sensor detects the heat in the form of infrared radiation.
The sensor only detects the energy emitted by other objects and don‟t produce any, that's why the sensor is called a PIR or "Passive Infra-Red" sensor. These sensors are small, cheap, rugged, low power and very easy to use.


Connections:
With Arduino,
∙	Connect the VCC of the PIR sensor to the 5v pin of Arduino.
∙	Then connect the output pin to D13
∙	GND to the Ground pin of the Arduino.
∙	Connect the LED to the D2 pin of the Arduino.

∙	Now upload the code and test
 


Code:
int LED = 13; // the pin that the LED is attached to int PIR = 2; // the pin that the sensor is attached to
void setup() {
pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // initialize LED as an output
pinMode(PIR, INPUT); // initialize sensor as an input Serial.begin(9600); // initialize serial
}
void loop(){
if (digitalRead(PIR) == HIGH) { // check if the sensor is HIGH digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turn LED ON
Serial.println("Motion detected!"); delay(100); // delay 100 milliseconds } else {
digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turn LED OFF Serial.println("Motion stopped!"); delay(100); // delay 100 milliseconds }
}

Output: Motion detected Motion detected Motion detected Motion detected Motion stopped Motion stopped Motion detected Motion detected Motion detected Motion stopped
