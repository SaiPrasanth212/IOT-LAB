10.To build a Prototype for Water Controller system

“Iot Based Automatic Water Controller” the input is given to the Ultrasonic sensor which is used to sense the water level. Then it sends to the signals to buzzer , led and motor. Buzzer and Leds are act as a alerting system. This indicates when the water tank is full. If the tank is full then the relay stops the water pump automatically, because it acts as a switch. If the water goes into the below level which is given by us, then the relay automatically switches on the water pump and it fills the water in the tank up to high level which is also given by us according to the tank size.
