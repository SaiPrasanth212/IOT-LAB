Aim: Design a system using Arduino where you can monitor Temperature and Humidity of a place on an LCD.

Hardware Library: ARDUINO UNO


Components: Temp. And Humidity Sensor

Theory:

DHT11 Sensor:
The DHT11 is a basic, low cost digital temperature and humidity sensor.

∙	DHT11 is a single wire digital humidity and temperature sensor, which provides humidity and temperature values serially with one-wire protocol.
∙	DHT11 sensor provides relative humidity value in percentage (20 to 90% RH) and temperature values in degree Celsius (0 to 50 °C).
∙	DHT11 sensor uses resistive humidity measurement component, and NTC temperature measurement component.

Explanation:
Physical Connections:-

In breadboard connect DHT11 sensor

Back side pins of sensor:- ( in breadboard vertical connections( in between) are there)

1)	VCC to 5v in Arduino board
2)	DATA to pin 4 of digital pin of Arduino
3)	Gnd to Gnd of Arduino board Connect USB from lappy to Arduino

Code:
#include <dht11.h> #define DHT11PIN 4 dht11 DHT11;
void setup()
{
 


Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop()
{
Serial.println();
int chk = DHT11.read(DHT11PIN); Serial.print("Humidity (%): "); Serial.println((float)DHT11.humidity, 2); Serial.print("Temperature (C): ");
Serial.println((float)DHT11.temperature, 2); delay(2
000); }
Output:
