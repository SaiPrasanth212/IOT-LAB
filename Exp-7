Aim: Design a system using Arduino where you can monitor Soil Moisture of a plant on an LCD
If soil moisture is less, then LED should glow. 

Hardware Library: ARDUINO UNO


Simulator: Proteus

Components: Soil Moisture Sensor, Arduino UNO, Jumping wires, LED

Theory:

Soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighing of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, as a proxy for the moisture content.
 


Connections:

Code:
int sensorPin = A0; int sensorValue; int limit = 300;

void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); Serial.println("Analog Value : "); Serial.println(sensorValue);

if (sensorValue<limit) { digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
}
else {
digitalWrite(13, LOW);
 


}

delay(1000);
}
Output:
